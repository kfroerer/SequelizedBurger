# Burger

Utilizing Sequelize and MySQL, this CRUD web application can serve as a template for any food industry. Keep track of available menu items (in this case burgers) as well as those already consumed. 

In this case, users can even request custom burgers using the input field. Each burger is added to the database and updated when 'eaten'. Need to delete an item? Not a problem! 

Initially I had set this up without Sequelize. Converting it over to utilize it was simple and resulted in cleaner, easier-to-read code. 

Bootstrap 4 was used for the UI and the appetizing carousel images were found on pixabay.
